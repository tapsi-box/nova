= Nova: The Tapsi Box Spring Initializr
:library: https://github.com/spring-io/initializr
:source-repo: https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io

Welcome to **Nova**, the official Tapsi Box instance of the {library}[Spring Initializr].

Inspired by the Latin word for "new"—referencing a new star that suddenly shines with brilliance—Nova is designed to be a powerful, fresh presence in our development workflow. Its purpose is to bootstrap new projects with a burst of efficiency, ensuring they are standardized and ready for development from the very beginning.

This repository configures a customized Spring Initializr instance that is pre-loaded with Tapsi Box's unique development standards, including:

*   **Custom Dependencies:** All Tapsi Box-specific libraries and shared modules, sourced directly from our private Artifactory.
*   **Architectural Templates:** Opinionated project structures that align with Tapsi Box's architectural best practices.
*   **Static Configuration:** Boilerplate configuration files and settings commonly used across our services.

This instance is a fork of the official {source-repo}[start.spring.io] repository. The following modules from the original project are used:

* `start-client`: client-side assets
* `start-site`: server infrastructure and metadata configuration
* `start-site-verification`: tests to verify the validity of the metadata

[[using]]
== Using

There is a link:USING.adoc[dedicated page] that describes how you can interact with the service.

IMPORTANT: To build projects generated by Nova, you must provide your credentials for the Tapsi Box Artifactory. Update the `gradle.properties` file in your Gradle home directory (`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`) with the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
# Tapsi Artifactory Credentials
# Provide your username and password for Tapsi's private repository.
tapsiArtifactoryUsername=YOUR_USERNAME
tapsiArtifactoryPassword=YOUR_PASSWORD
----

[[build]]
== Building from Source

To build and run this project locally, you will need Java 17 and a bash-like shell.

[[building]]
=== Building

Invoke the build at the root of the project:

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw clean install
----

The project also includes a number of longer-running verification tests. They can be built and run using the `verification` profile:

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw -Pverification clean install
----

The project's other tests are not included in the `verification` profile. All of the project's tests can be run using the `full` profile:

[indent=0]
----
    $ ./mvnw -Pfull clean install
----

If building `start-client` fails, you may have an outdated cache that can be deleted as follows:

[indent=0]
----
    $ cd start-client
    $ rm -rf .cache node_modules
----

[[run-app]]
=== Running the app locally
As long as you've built the project beforehand (in particular `start-client`), you can easily start the app as any other Spring Boot app:

[indent=0]
----
    $ cd start-site
    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run
----

[[run-ide]]
=== Running the app in an IDE
You should be able to import the project into your IDE with no problems. Once there you can run the `StartApplication` from its main method and debug it.

This is the recommended way to operate while you are developing the application.
